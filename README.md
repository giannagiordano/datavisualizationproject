For my third project, I created a data visualization using data on military expenditure as a percentage of government spending per country in 2017. My data set is from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), which has a Military Expenditure Database with data on military spending from 1949 to 2017. When we started the data visualization unit, I knew that I wanted to create a map visualizing some sort of international comparison. I was inspired by a data visualization by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the ratification of international human rights treaties, so I sought out a data set that I could play around with to create a similar mapping project.

As I was browsing for data sets, I came across SIPRI's Military Expenditure Database. SIPRI links to its own data visualization, which compares countries' military spending in US dollars. Because SIPRI has many sets of data but only visualizes that particular one, I thought it would be interesting to see what a visualization of military expenditure as a percentage of government spending would look like. I thought that military spending as a percentage of government spending had the potential to show how much countries prioritize military expenditures over expenditures in other areas, and, as expected, the visualization looked completely different than that of military spending in raw US dollars. The latter draws attention to the US and China while the former draws attention to Sudan, Saudi Arabia, and Oman.

As I looked at the map comparing countries based on military expenditure as a percentage of government spending, I realized that I knew very little about the three countries that were catching my attention - Sudan, Saudi Arabia, and Oman. I wanted to learn more about these countries - where they're located, what government structures are in place there, and why they spend so much of their annual budgets on the military. I dug deeper, looking at newspaper articles and other databases, such as the Central Intelligence Agency's World Factbook. I picked out pieces of information that I found interesting and thought that other users might be curious to know as well. I created three "case studies" on Sudan, Saudi Arabia, and Oman, including both general information and specific facts on military spending. 

To put my project together, I added a title page and hook pages. I explain how military spending as a percentage of government spending has the potential to show how much countries prioritize military expernditures over expenditures in other areas and then ask users which countries they think spend the highest percentages of their budgets on military expenditures. I anticipate that they will not guess correctly and then be hungry to learn more. After the hook pages come my "case studies." Each country has a scene with a few news headlines and then another page with more in-depth information. When the mouse is to the left of the center line, facts on military spending are displayed on top of an image of the country on a map. When the mouse is to the right of the center line, general information is displayed on top of the country's flag. At the bottom of the last scene is a link to an interactive map that displays the SIPRI data set using leaflet. 

Using scene manager allows users to click through my scenes as they please - maybe they are particularly interested in reading about these three countries, maybe they just want to browse the news headlines, or many they want to click through the scenes to get to the interactive map at the end. I included many didactic elements so it is nearly impossible to look at my project without learning something new. I chose to make the first and last scenes bright red with white text because these color choices are asesthetically pleasing but also draw attention to the fact that this is a serious topic. I then used 'coolors' to find colors that compliment this bright red and created my own palette for this sketch. I also wanted to make sure that the font looked sharp on the background and this led me to choose the Abel font from google fonts. 

Although entering every percentage manually into a geoJSON file was tedious, I learned a lot from working on this data visualization project and I really liked how my own curiousity about the data set that I found led me to build a story around military expenditure as a percentage of government spending for users to interact with. Using scenemanager.js was also satisfying because it allowed me to create clean scenes that don't feel too overwhelming with information. I hope that users will be fascinated by the way this visualization turns what you would normally think about military spending on its head and use my project to feed their curiosity to learn more.
